Thanks Vivien.  

Noramly, when you shop online, there are millions of products, inbetween you can find some of them are quite similar.
However, how can a system identify it. One way is to identify the terms similarity.

For a product, its title contains many information, style, brand or others.   
Take below two skirts as an example. We can find the two products' title have XXXXXXXXXX in common. We can say to some extend,
they are common. Also, they have distinct characteristic, say for example, the left one is house print, while the right one is
the cartoon print.

Here we have a dataset, which contains the item id, category id, terms (pls be noted that the terms has already been transformed
into numbers), and image data (it's optional, not all items has, today we may focus on the terms)   
Here are some sample data.
